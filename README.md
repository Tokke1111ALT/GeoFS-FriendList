# GeoFS Friends List ‚Äì Tampermonkey Script<br/>
A handy script/addon to add friends and see who is online in GeoFS (Geography Flight Simulator). <br/>

## Description<br/>
This Tampermonkey script adds a friends list to GeoFS , so you can always know which pilots (by their callsigns) are currently online. You can manually add friends, and the script will track whether they're active in the game.<br/>

The script shows:<br/>
<br/>
‚úÖ Online friends (with aircraft name)<br/>
‚ùå Offline friends<br/>
üü¢/‚ö´ Status icon next to the player count indicating if any friends are online<br/>
All data is stored locally using localStorage.<br/>

## Installation<br/>
Install a userscript manager such as:<br/>
Tampermonkey<br/>
Greasemonkey<br/>
Go to the script page or download the .user.js file.<br/>
Click "New Script" in your manager and paste the contents of the script.<br/>
Open GeoFS and click the friends icon next to the player counter to open the list.<br/>

## Features<br/>
Add friends by their callsign<br/>
Remove friends from your list<br/>
Automatically see who is online<br/>
Color indication (green/black) for online/offline status<br/>

## Feature ideas<br/>
Teleport to friend<br/>
Marking them on map<br/>
Name color in-game<br/>
Name color in-chat<br/>
Private chat box (Groups chats)<br/>
(Distance from you to friend)<br/>
Save player-ID so if ur friend changes Callsign U will see him online in ur friendlist under his current callsign (currently working on)<br/>


## UI Location<br/>
After installation, a friends icon will appear next to the player count in GeoFS. Click it to open the friend list panel.<br/>

## Data Storage<br/>
All friends are stored in localStorage. This means:<br/>

The list persists between sessions<br/>
Only you have access to this data<br/>
No external servers or tracking involved<br/>

## Not Working?<br/>
Make sure:<br/>

You filled in the callsign(name) in correctly for now its capital sensitive<br/>
You're using the latest version of GeoFS<br/>
Your script manager is working correctly<br/>
You don't have conflicting scripts running<br/>
If it still doesn‚Äôt work, please create an issue on the GitHub page<br/>

### Know issues:<br/>
It does not work when u have chat enabled<br/>
If u type in the callsign the keybinds ingame are still active<br/>
Your're friend won't appear anymore if he changed his Callsign (see Feature ideas)<br/>
